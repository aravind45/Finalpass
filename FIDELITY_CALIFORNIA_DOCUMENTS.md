## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "We need the original death certificate"
**Solution:** Fidelity accepts certified copies. If they insist, escalate to supervisor. California law allows certified copies.

### Issue 2: "Your Letters Testamentary are expired"
**Solution:** Letters don't expire in California, but Fidelity may want recent ones. Request updated certified copies from court ($15 each).

### Issue 3: "We need a Medallion Signature Guarantee"
**Solution:** 
- Go to your bank (must be a customer)
- Bring: Letters Testamentary, government ID, Fidelity forms
- Ask specifically for "Medallion Signature Guarantee" (not notarization)

### Issue 4: "We can't find any accounts"
**Solution:**
- Check tax returns for 1099 forms
- Search mail for statements
- Call Fidelity with SSN and date of birth (after providing death certificate)

### Issue 5: "We need beneficiary designation forms"
**Solution:** These should be in the Estate Settlement Packet. If not, request them specifically.

- Fidelity
- Other financial institutions
- Social Security
- Insurance companies
- DMV (vehicle titles)
- Real estate transfers

### 2. **Keep Copies of Everything**
- Scan all documents before sending
- Use certified mail with tracking
- Keep a log of what you sent and when

You can:

- Just can't submit until you have Letters Testamentary

### 4. **Ask About Beneficiary Designations**
If accounts have named beneficiaries, they may bypass probate entirely. Ask Fidelity to check.
