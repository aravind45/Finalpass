# Insurance & Employer Benefits in Estate Settlement

## Overview

Yes, estate settlements **absolutely include** insurance policies and employer benefits. In fact, these are often among the **most valuable and time-sensitive assets** in an estate.

## Why These Matter

### Financial Impact
- **Life insurance** can be the largest single asset (often $100K-$1M+)
- **401(k)/retirement accounts** often exceed $200K-$500K
- **Employer benefits** can include unpaid salary, vacation pay, stock options
- **Combined value** often represents 40-60% of total estate value

### Time Sensitivity
- **Life insurance claims** have filing deadlines (typically 1-2 years)
- **Employer benefits** must be claimed quickly (30-90 days)
- **Retirement accounts** have distribution requirements
