# Detailed Workflow & Document Mapping for Top Pain Areas

## Pain Area #1: Financial Institution Communication (Universal Problem)

### The Complete Broken Workflow:

#### Step 1: Initial Contact Attempt
```
Executor Action: Calls Fidelity customer service
Time Investment: 45-90 minutes (hold time + transfers)
Outcome: "We need death certificate and Letters Testamentary"
Documents Requested: 
- Certified death certificate
- Letters Testamentary (original or certified copy)
- Account statements (if available)
```

#### Step 2: Document Preparation & Submission
```
Executor Action: Gathers documents, submits via mail/fax
Time Investment: 2-4 hours (driving to get certificates, copying, mailing)
Documents Submitted:
- Death certificate (certified) - $25 cost
- Letters Testamentary (certified copy) - $15 cost  
- Cover letter with account numbers
- Return envelope (if requesting documents back)

Submission Methods by Institution:
- Fidelity: Secure email or certified mail
- Vanguard: Fax or mail only
- Schwab: Online portal or mail
- Invesco: Mail or fax (no secure email)
```

#### Step 3: The Black Hole Period
```
Timeline: Days 1-14 after submission
Executor Experience: Complete silence
What's Actually Happening at Institution:
- Day 1-3: Documents sit in mail room
- Day 4-7: Routed to estate services department
- Day 8-10: Initial review, may request additional documents
- Day 11-14: Assigned to processor, enters queue

Pain Points:
- No confirmation of receipt
- No timeline provided
- No status updates
- Executor doesn't know if documents were lost
```

#### Step 4: First Follow-up Attempt
```
Day 14: Executor calls for status update
Hold Time: 30-60 minutes
Response: "Your case is being processed, no timeline available"
Frustration Level: High
Next Action: Told to "call back in a week"

Documents Still Needed (Often Not Communicated):
- Beneficiary designation forms (institution-specific)
- New account application for estate
- Tax ID number for estate (EIN)
- Distribution instructions
```

#### Step 5: Escalation Cycle
```
Day 21: Second follow-up call
Response: "Still processing, very complex"
Day 28: Third call, request supervisor
Supervisor Response: "These take 4-6 weeks typically"
Day 35: Fourth call, executor getting angry
Response: "We'll expedite your case"

Reality Check:
- No actual expediting happens
- Executor has invested 8+ hours in phone calls
- Still no concrete timeline
- Other beneficiaries calling executor asking for updates
```

Message: "We need additional documentation"
New Requirements:
- Beneficiary forms (should have been provided initially)
- Estate tax ID number
- Medallion signature guarantee (not mentioned before)

Executor Reaction: Rage
Time Lost: 6 weeks

```
Day 50: Resubmit with all required documents
Day 65: Finally processed and transferred
