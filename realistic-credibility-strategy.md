# Realistic Strategy: Building Credibility with Invesco

## What I Actually Meant by "Processing Estates Manually"

**NOT:** Handling 50+ real estate cases (that would take 2-3 years!)

**ACTUALLY:** Using your platform to process 5-10 real estates to create compelling case studies and proof points for Invesco.

## Realistic Credibility Building Approach

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Month 1-2)
**Goal:** Process 3-5 estates through your platform to demonstrate value

**How to Get These Estates:**
1. **Facebook estate groups** - Find people currently struggling with Invesco
2. **Reddit r/EstatePlanning** - Offer free service to document the process
3. **Local estate attorneys** - Partner for 2-3 test cases
4. **Your network** - Friends/family who need estate help

**What You're Actually Doing:**
- Using your platform to generate perfect Invesco forms
- Coordinating their document submission
- Tracking the process and timing everything
- Documenting the before/after experience

### Phase 2: Create Compelling Data (Month 2-3)
**From just 5 estates, you can generate:**

```
Case Study Data:
- Average processing time: 45 days vs 90 days (50% improvement)
- Executor time saved: 20 hours per estate
- Error rate: 0% vs 30% (no rejected forms)
- Customer satisfaction: 5/5 stars vs typical 2/5
- Cost savings: $1,000+ per estate
```

### Phase 3: Approach Invesco with Proof (Month 3)
**Your pitch becomes:**
"We've processed 5 Invesco estates and reduced your processing time by 50%. Here's the data..."

## Alternative Credibility Strategies (Even Faster)

### Option 1: Simulation Approach
**Create realistic test cases using:**
- Public probate records (names redacted)
- Typical estate scenarios
- Invesco's actual forms and requirements
- Demonstrate the workflow without real estates

### Option 2: Attorney Partnership
**Partner with 1-2 estate attorneys who:**
- Handle Invesco cases regularly
- Can validate your process
- Provide testimonials about efficiency gains
- Give you credibility when approaching Invesco

### Option 3: Industry Research Approach
**Build credibility through data analysis:**
- Survey 50 executors about Invesco delays (via Reddit/Facebook)
- Analyze complaint patterns and processing times
- Create industry report on estate settlement inefficiencies
- Position yourself as the expert on the problem

## What "Manual Processing" Actually Means

### Before Your Platform:
```
Executor Experience:
1. Calls Invesco (45 min wait)
2. Gets wrong forms mailed (7 days)
3. Fills out incorrectly (2 hours)
4. Resubmits (another week)
5. Waits in silence (8 weeks)
6. Makes follow-up calls (5+ calls)
Total: 12+ weeks, 25+ hours
```

### With Your Platform (Still "Manual" Submission):
```
Executor Experience:
1. Uploads documents to your platform (10 min)
2. Reviews pre-filled forms (5 min)
3. Platform coordinates certified mail (automated)
4. Receives weekly status updates (automated)
5. Platform sends professional follow-ups (automated)
Total: 6 weeks, 2 hours
```

**The "manual" part:** Documents still go to Invesco via mail/fax
**The "digital" part:** Everything else is automated and tracked

## Realistic Timeline to Approach Invesco

### Week 1-2: Build MVP
- Create form generation system
- Set up tracking dashboard
- Develop automated email templates

### Week 3-4: Find 2-3 Test Cases
- Post in estate Facebook groups
- Offer free service to document process
- Partner with local estate attorney

### Week 5-8: Process Test Cases
- Generate forms for real estates
- Track submission and follow-up process
- Document time savings and efficiency gains

### Week 9-10: Create Case Studies
- Before/after comparisons
- Time and cost savings analysis
- Customer testimonials

### Week 11-12: Approach Invesco
- Contact estate services manager
- Present data-driven efficiency proposal
- Request pilot program meeting

## The Real Value Proposition to Invesco

**You're not asking them to change their systems.**
**You're offering to make their current process more efficient.**

```
Your Pitch:
"We pre-process estates before they reach you:
- Perfect forms (no rejections)
- Complete documentation (no back-and-forth)
- Proactive communication (fewer customer service calls)
- Digital tracking (better audit trails)

Result: 50% faster processing, 80% fewer support calls"
```

## Key Insight

You don't need 50 estates to prove your concept. You need **5 well-documented cases** that show clear efficiency gains. Quality over quantity.

The "manual" processing I mentioned isn't about doing everything by hand - it's about working within Invesco's current paper-based requirements while digitizing everything else around it.

Does this make more sense? The goal is to prove your platform works with just a few real cases, not to become a full-scale estate processing business before approaching Invesco.
